            <p class="article"> 
                As a quiet kid who moved around a lot, I was always looking for new ways to express myself.<br> 
                It started with long drives and loud music, staring out the window and pretending to be the protagonist in the nonexistent music video that I called life.<br> 
                Before I knew it, that love for music had escalated into creating music of my own. But after a while that wasn't enough... <br>
                I needed more. I needed visual ways to express myself. Thats when I found my love for photography, design, and development.<br>
                After freelancing for a while I went on to the lead the marketing efforts of a few businesses and entrepreneurs. <br>
                Eventually, after having two adorable children, I got my Real Estate license. Getting my real estate license allowed me to take all the things that I was already doing for everyone else, and apply them to my <em>own</em>
                business. <br>
                But despite any of my successes or talents/skills, theres always been something weighing heavy on my heart.<br>
                The need to finally become a developer.<br>
                <p class="center">Wish me luck</p>
